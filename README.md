# JSX
- JSX - HTML like or XML like syntax.
- JSX is not HTML inside JavaScript.
- JS Engine doesn't understand JSX(Not pure JavaScript).
- JSX code transpiled before it goes to JS Engine.
- Transpiled means converting code into browser understandable code.
- PARCEL -> BABEL (Complier to converted code)
- JSX -> React.createElement -> React Element - Object -> HTMLElement (render).
- const jsxheading = <h1 className="heading"> JSX starting...</h1>;
- className="heading" for JSX syntax which is converted into HTML syntax in browser class="heading"
